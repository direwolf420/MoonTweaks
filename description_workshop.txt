This clientside mod allows you to tweak the visible moon in various ways.

You can affect the moon style in two ways:
* Randomize moon style every night (including specials ("Extra"))
* Set custom moon style

Other settings:
* Set custom moon phase

Because this is clientside, it does not affect the moon state for other players/server, or the world itself (disabling the mod restores the visible moon state).
(Due to tml implementation of configs, in the main menu, moon style changes are only applied upon saving, then exiting the mod list. The special moons do not appear in the main menu either.)
